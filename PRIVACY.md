# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [DATE]_

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Docfactory** plugin (“the Plugin”) processes data when used within your Dify instance.

The Plugin is designed with privacy by default: **no data is transferred outside of your Dify environment**, and **no data is sold, shared, or disclosed to any third party**.

---

## 1. Data Controller

For the purposes of this Plugin, the **data controller** is the operator/owner of the Dify instance where the Plugin is installed (“you” or “the Instance Operator”).

The Plugin developer does **not** have access to any data processed by the Plugin in your environment.

---

## 2. Scope of This Policy

This Policy applies only to the **Docfactory** Plugin as installed in your Dify environment.  
It does **not** cover any other plugins, services, or systems that you may use in conjunction with Dify.

---

## 3. Data Processed by the Plugin

Depending on how you configure and use the Plugin, it may process the following types of data:

- User prompts and messages
- Responses generated by models
- Documents and files you choose to load or reference
- Metadata associated with those documents (e.g., titles, tags, identifiers)
- Technical logs necessary for debugging within your environment

All such data is processed **only inside your Dify instance**.

---

## 4. No External Data Transfers

The Plugin does **not**:

- Send data to any external servers or APIs owned or controlled by the Plugin developer.
- Transmit data to third-party services on its own.
- Collect telemetry, analytics, or usage statistics for external reporting.

All data remains within the boundaries of your Dify deployment (e.g., your own servers, infrastructure, or cloud environment that you control).

---

## 5. No Data Sharing or Sale

The Plugin does **not** sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose any data to third parties.

No data processed by the Plugin is shared with:

- The Plugin developer
- Marketing or advertising partners
- Analytics or tracking providers
- Any other external entity

---

## 6. Data Storage and Retention

The Plugin itself does not implement its own separate persistent storage beyond what is provided and configured in Dify.

- Any data stored (such as documents, segments, or logs) is saved using your existing Dify and infrastructure configuration.
- Data retention, backup, and deletion are governed by your own policies and settings as the Instance Operator.

---

## 7. Security

The Plugin relies on the **security measures of your Dify deployment** and underlying infrastructure.

You, as the Instance Operator, are responsible for:

- Securing access to the Dify instance and its storage
- Managing user accounts, permissions, and roles
- Applying appropriate network, host, and data security measures

The Plugin does not introduce any intentional mechanisms to bypass or weaken these protections.

---

## 8. Your Responsibilities

Because the Plugin runs entirely within your environment, you are responsible for:

- Ensuring that the use of the Plugin complies with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., data protection, privacy, and retention laws).
- Informing your end users about how their data is processed within your systems.
- Configuring Dify and any connected services in a compliant and secure manner.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If you distribute or bundle this Plugin, you should ensure that your users are informed of any relevant changes.

The “Last updated” date at the top of this document indicates when this Policy was last revised.
